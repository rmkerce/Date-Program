Date Program
This program merely tested my abilities with default and explicit value constructors, as well as destructors and function calling.
This assignment was the first one in a Data Structures class I took in Spring 2016, and I learned a lot about constructors by doing this assignment. I also learned a lot about linking files together with classes and header files.
I received an A on this assignment and enjoyed writing the code for it.
